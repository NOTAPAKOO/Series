The scene opens with K-19 making their way from their office to the tram. They are clearly upset, groaning as they hate having to do work for Addy.

As they make their way up the stairs up to Addy's office, they are greeted by K-22 standing by the door.

K-19 approaches K-22, who is guarding the door to Addy's office.

K-19 sighs.

K-19: What are you doing, K-22?

K-22: Addy's sleeping, so no one is allowed in.

K-19: *groans* I have a report I need to give to them, so can you please move? 

K-22: *smiles* I'll take them and give them to Addy when they wake up!

K-19 looks at K-22 for a moment, and then reaches for the door.

K-22 sticks their arms out to block them.

K-19: Damnit, just let me in so I can drop this off!

K-22: No! Let them sleep!

K-19: What is wrong with you K-22? You are way too obsessed with Addy!

As the arguing continues, K-17 peeks around the corner.

K-22 is guarding the door with their life as K-19 constantly bothers them.

K-17: what's going on?

K-19: K-22 is being a prick and not letting me in.

K-22: Why can't you just be nice to Addy?

K-19: I just want to get this shit over with!

K-19 goes over to look through the window, and K-22 jumps in front of them. K-17 looks through the other window, and K-22 goes to block them. K-19 takes this chance and starts banging on the door.

K-19: Addy! Open up!

K-22: No!

K-19: *imitating K-22* Oh Addy! I actually fucking hate you!

K-22: Shut up! That's not true!

All of a sudden, Addy opens the door and stares down at K-19.

Addy: Yes, I know you hate me, do you have your report?

K-19 gathers his bearings and hands Addy the papers.

K-19: thank God, I'm getting back to work.

K-22: I'm sorry about all that, I just-

Addy: Yes yes, you're fine. Just get back to your office.

K-22: Yes Addy!

K-22 and K-19 walk away.

K-17 is still standing there, just staring at the floor.

Addy looks confused.

Addy: Did you, need something as well?

K-17 perks up.

K-17: Oh sorry, I, just wanted to see what happened.

Addy: What?

K-17: Yeah I just, wanted to see what happened.

Addy looks even more confused.

Addy: Okay?

K-17: Yeah I'm just gonna go now.

K-17: Bye Addy.

Addy: See ya…

As K-17 walks away, Addy peers down both sides of the hallway.

Addy: Okay, looks like the coast is clear.

Addy goes back into their office.
