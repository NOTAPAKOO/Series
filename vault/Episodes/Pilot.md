The scene opens up with K-17 talking to himself, recording a memory for themselves.

K-17: Hello! I'm K-17. I work in this facility, and we like to archive stuff. We work on saving memories of, someone named Pakoo. And I think we are fragments of their memory? I don't really know. But I like doing what I do! I'm a K-type, which means I'm awesome! Well, it actually means that I own this whole building! There are D-types, which do the basic work, in which they report to the M-types, which they review and send to me! And then I report to The Administrator. Or who I like to call, Addy, which is short for Administrator. I'll have to see if they like that name. Anyways, there are 5 of us K-types, from 17 to 21. I don't know where the other 16 went, but oh well. Anyways, what else happens here? Well there is–

K-17 gets cut off by the sound of knocking on their office door.

K-17: Ah shit. Well, I have to get back to my job, hopefully someone cool will find this!

K-17 puts their recorder away and opens the door.

Standing there is an M-type with a huge memory capsule.

K-17-10: Welp, we found what The Administrator wanted. I think it's a, map? I don't really know what it's of, but-

K-17: Cool thanks!

K-17 takes the capsule and wheelies it away down to the tram.

K-17 gets on the tram and punches in the key to Addy's office.

While the tram takes off, K-17 looks out the window across the facility.

There are a bunch of abandoned buildings, which K-17 peers at.

The tram stops at the stairs up to Addy's office.

K-17 rolls the capsule out and looks at the many stairs up to Addy's office.

K-17: Man, we need an elevator…

K-17 then meticulously pulls the capsule up all the stairs.

Scene shows Addy in their office, when the door blasts open to show an exhausted. Sweaty K-17. Addy looks confused.

K-17: Oh, holy, shit, can, we, get an elevator at some point?

Addy: We have a cargo elevator down to the left before the stairs, how did you not see it?

K-17 lets out a sigh of disbelief.

K-17: Whatever, I got it here regardless. (wheels in the capsule) Here you go.

Addy: Thank you thank you, I can't believe we finally found this.

Addy stares into the capsule as K-17 was about to leave, as they turn around to ask Addy a question.

K-17: Hey uhh, what do you think of the name Addy?

Addy: What do you mean?

K-17: Well, we all call you the Administrator, why not Addy for short?

Addy: Hmm…

K-17: I mean, you kinda look like an Addy.

Addy: Do I?

K-17 shakes their head up and down.

Addy: I'll give it some thought. Now, lemme see what we have here…

K-17 goes back down to the tram, and gives the abandoned facility some more thought.

K-17: Hmm…

K-17 stops the tram off by K-19's building.

K-17 walks over to K-19's office and knocks on the door.

K-17: It's me, K-17! I have an important message for you!

K-19: Ugh…

K-19 groggily opens the door.

K-19: What's up.

K-17: The administrator assigned ME to help out doing a mission with YOU!

K-19: Fuck, really? They must know how much I hate this place…

K-17: Okay okay, they didn't actually say that, but I've given some thought about the buildings across from us, and we should go check it out!

K-19: Do I have to? I got shit to do…

K-17: whispers What if there is something out there outside the facility?  
K-19: You're telling me I should leave here to go check out the creepy ass buildings and try to get out here?

K-17: *worried* I guess, so?

K-19: Well fuck, sign me up then!

K-17 brightens up.

K-17: Sweet! Let's go!

K-17 grabs K-19 by the arm and drags them.

K-19 Hey wait!

As K-17 drags K-19 out of their office, the scene pans up to them walking to the tram.

K-19: Damn, I'm tired as hell already!

K-17: We've only been walking for a few minutes! How are you already tired?

K-19: Because I have to use energy!

K-17: Well, let's hurry up before our boss sees us!

POV shot of Addy's screens watching them.

K-19: They are locked away in their office all day, why would they come down to find us?

K-17: I don't know man, but I feel like this is something we should be somewhat secretive about.

They get on the tram.

K-17: The Administrator has never mentioned anything about those buildings before, so I'm given the hint that we aren't supposed to know either!

K-17: I mean, there could be anything over there!

K-19: Let's just get this over with, so I can go back to doing nothing.

K-17: I thought you had shit to do?

K-19: Yeah, my plan today was to do nothing.

K-17: Okay, whatever man.

The scene cuts to the tram stopping at the main station, as K-17 and K-19 try to find a way to the other side.

K-17: Let's try going through these doors.

K-19: I never even noticed that these were here…

K-17: My curiosity started to emerge ever since we started working. Like there has to be something strange going on here, I mean I can't even remember how I got here in the first place!

K-19: Ehh, I never bothered to worry about that.

K-17: That's the thing, I feel like The Administrator is hiding something from us.

K-19: Well, there's a fork in the path. Which way should we go?

K-17: Hmm…

K-17: Let's go left!

They jiggle the door, but it seems to be locked.

K-17: Okay then, let's go right!

K-17 opens the door, only to reveal a small closet.

K-17: Aw man, what the fuck is this?

K-19: It's called a closet. Have you not seen one before?

K-17: Alright, shut up. Let's try going right.

The two K-types travel down the right path before opening a door to a very dark and musty facility room.

K-17: Woah, what is this place?

K-19: This is probably the facilities of the old K-types. Y'know, the ones that the administrator killed?

K-17: WHAT?

K-19 lets out a hard laugh.

K-19: I'm just fucking with ya, man.

K-19: But seriously though, I have no clue what this is. I don't trust the Administrator at all, and this place makes me trust them less.

While K-17 is looking at the dusty old canisters, he talks to K-19 about their new idea for a nickname.

K-17: Yeah well, besides that, I've been thinking. I feel like calling them the administrator is kind of a mouth full.

K-17: Like, what if we called them Addy for short?

K-19: That sounds really dumb, and I feel like it makes me hate them more.

K-17: Why? It's short, sweet, and actually sounds like a name!

K-19: Look, I don't want to think about Add- The administrator more than I already do!

K-17: See look, you unconsciously admitted that Addy is an easier name to say.

K-19: Whatever, let's hurry up here so we can get out of this creepy place.

While they finish looking around, they spot a set of double doors at the far end of the facility.

K-17: Hey look at that! More doors!

K-19: Great, the mystery gets deeper.

K-17: C'mon, last thing to check out, and then we can leave. Besides, if you hate Addy so much, why would you wanna go back?

K-19: At least when I'm at my desk, I can pretend to be working. I'm already exhausted from walking around.

K-17: But isn't this just so exciting? We've never seen anything like this before!

K-17 grabs K-19 and drags them over to the doors.

Thankfully, the doors are unlocked, and K-17 opens the set of doors.

K-17: Hey, at least these doors aren't locked!

K-19: I uh, yeah. That's good at least, I guess.

The doors open up into one final, very dark hallway, which leads to a final set of double doors.

K-17: Woah, it's extremely dark here…

K-17: Did you bring a light?

K-19: No…

K-19: I didn't think we were going down dark corridors!

K-19: There's nothing here, so why don't we just head back now?

As K-19 is finishing their sentence, they hear the sound of wind howling at the end of the hallway.

K-19: Hold on…

K-19: Do you hear that?

K-17: The wind howling outside? Yeah, I hear–

K-19 starts running down the hallway towards the noise.

K-17: Hey wait! Wait for me! I can't see!

They keep running until they reach the end, as they both feel around for the exit.

K-19: Holy shit, this is extremely cold. K-17, come put your hand here.

K-17 follows his voice and attempts to feel where he mentioned.

The texture feels smooth and extremely cold, as if you put your hand on a freezer wall.

K-17: Dang, that's freezing. Is there like, a handle or something?

K-19 feels around for a bit, until he lands on a protruding metal rod, which he grabs and tries to turn.

K-19: Figures. The door is stuck.

K-19: Help me pull, K-17.

K-17 grabs onto K-19 and pulls as hard as possible, until the door finally rips open, blinding them with white light.
