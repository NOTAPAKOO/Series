Early on in the GIT Era, Xander GIT's favorite creatures, Yoshi and Koopa, waged war on Mario and his gang. Yoshi and Koopa teamed up with the Angry Birds, the Bad Piggies, and Blinky and Pinky from Pac-Man. Mario took several beatings, so he called for help, bringing in his brother Luigi, Cool Kid (Who wasn't actually very cool), Woody, and Buzz Lightyear (who were their partners).Even though the war was in favor of Yoshi and Koopa, they hired a man that was known as "The Swordsman", even though he also used Heavy Weapons. Cool Kid and Mario were brutally murdered, and Luigi finally died after taking many hits. Xander GIT enjoyed their victory so much, he rewinded time just to watch them win again. After that, Yoshi and co. humiliated them so much that they skinned them and used them for other purposes. Once the battle was finally over, Yoshi and the crew wanted to conquer the rest of GIT Land. They start making their own money. They paid the swordsman a ton of money to kill everyone else. This consists of:
