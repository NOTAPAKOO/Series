After Pakoo launched David into space, he was knocked unconscious until he hit the surface of a moon. His mech destroyed, stranded, and with a burning revenge to get back at Pakoo and his nation, he got to work repairing his vehicle. Once he could space travel, he started stopping by every little hub of civilization he could find to try to track down Pakoo. When David managed to make it back though, he came to a frozen Pakoostan, and also met Addy, who turned him into goop.
