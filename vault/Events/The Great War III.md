The Great War III, or The Third Great War, was yet another conflict between Pakoostan and The David Empire. The war started when HTC David mysteriously appears back on MS-420 in a Rocket-Mech designed as the POLYBIUS arcade machine. The incident occurred at Linus Media Group, where the Mech apparently blasted through the wall. Linus Sebastian noticed HTC David approaching from the debris, and decided to hide. Once he lost his sight, he ordered everyone in the building to exit the building as HTC David shot the Mech high into the air, and then crashing it down on the building, killing Linus in the process. This incident caused Pakoo to immediately work on upgrading his military status to fight the upcoming army. The David Empire's military now completely consists of Mechs, all controlled in Virtual Reality by HTC David. For the first time, the Pakoostan military was not strong enough to fight against the power of HTC David. This caused Pakoo to go out and single-handedly fight HTC David. This caused an epic duel between the two, lasting for many hours until finally Pakoo launches HTC David into space, never to be seen for a while. Back on MS-420, all of the smaller factions that remained began to start fighting over the land that once belonged to The David Empire.
