The Pakoostan Civil War occurs shortly after the arrival of Pakoo in Pakoostan. The local Pakoostanis start to treat this new traveler as a godlike form, and they say that he is the true fit for leadership. The current leader at the time, Konata Izumi, was not pleased by the citizen's actions. Konata declares war on Pakoo, while some of the Pakoostanis join his side on the fight. After a day or so of fighting, Konata and Pakoo fight each other in a 1 on 1. The battle lasts for less than an hour, when they both realize that they have a lot in common and drop their differences and decide to work together.
