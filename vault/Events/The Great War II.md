The Great War II, or The Second Great War, was a conflict between Pakoostan and The David Empire. HTC David rose to power and went to war against Pakoostan for revenge in the last war. HTC David started to heavily increase their military power and started using Virtual Reality Technology to train. Just when The David Empire was about to lose, HTC David sought to take down Linus Sebastian, Pakoostan's strongest military leader. After tracking him down, Linus and HTC David fought for a bit until Linus unleashed an unknown amount of power on HTC David, essentially removing him from existence.
