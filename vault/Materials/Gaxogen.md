Gaxogen Is an element that is the purest form of Xander GIT, and Xander's childhood. It is a gaseous, goo-like essence that can be found producing from most corners of GIT Land. It is very volatile to anything not recognized by Xander GIT/Early Pakoo, instantly consuming the unknown entity and sending it to the void. It works as an agent to keep anything from tainting Xander's childhood/GIT Land. It is also rumored to be the most powerful method of storage, but has not been researched fully. It is more powerful than the storage liquid Addy uses, which can be used to create an almost perfect copy of someone or something, if it's added to a memory tank and a host.
