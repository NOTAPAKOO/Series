The foundation of AG&A Co. starts with a conversation between the M-type Pakoos. It was about how everything works in the facility, which when Addy got involved into the conversation, ruined the workflow of the facility. This was when Addy had to let everyone know around the rules of the facility, where thinking about how something impossible works destroys it. Now, Addy has to create a railroad system hooked up to the facility to import goods to supply it. With the help of Anne and Grace, the train system flourished and helped the facility grow.
