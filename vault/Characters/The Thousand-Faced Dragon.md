The Thousand-Faced Dragon is a powerful being that lives in the void. As the name implies, the body of this snakelike flying creature is covered in faces. All of these faces are a collection of everyone that is known by Xander/Pakoo. This creature works as a judgemental figure for anyone or thing brought to the void via Gaxogen. If they are recognized, they are sent to a purgatory-like area that inflicts extremely heavy nostalgia on the user. If they are not recognized, the user is turned into the essence that makes up the void, and is slowly forgotten over time. The dragon only recognizes most people by face.
