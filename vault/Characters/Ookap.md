Evil Pakoo is the very first Pakoo to be unfrozen after the big freeze. Sworn to get revenge and bring back the people of the city, Evil Pakoo made it his goal to track down the cause of the freeze. Their left eye was blinded from the unfreezing, and has their hair back in a ponytail. They wear an all white suit, and dawn something resembling a Colt revolver. They are incredibly skilled and a good leader, but get cocky when they start to get the upper hand.
