Addy is the administrator of the archive facility, the leader of New Pakoostan, and the counterpart to Pakoo. They are the main connection from Layer 0 (Xander) to Layer 1 (Pakoo). Their main purpose is to save Xander's memories, and are able to create memory fluid (the solvent). They also have the abilities to save, alter, or delete memories from other people. In this world, Addy also has the power to physically change people, structures, or other creations made by Pakoo. Addy is getting weaker everyday, due to the lack of imagination. When Addy has to question why or how something works, it stops working unless a reasonable explanation is applied. This is why Pakoostan had to be manually rebuilt and AG&A Co. was founded.
