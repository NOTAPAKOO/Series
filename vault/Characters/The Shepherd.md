The Shepherd is the current owner of GIT Land, and Xander GIT/Pakoo's original mentor. As Xander GIT was aging, The Shepherd introduced themselves to make sure that GIT Land was archived once they moved past their childhood. In a way they are just like Addy, and opposite. They want Addy to be separate from Pakoo, so they can be themselves.
