David is the leader of the David Empire, and the main antagonist to Pakoo. They are the son of David, father of David. Their army was at war with the Pakoostanis for some time as far as David knows, and his father was murdered in the Great War. After this, David became the leader of the David Empire, and upped the ante of their army. They declared war on Pakoostan again, seeing some success in the beginning. Eventually though, they met Linus, one of Pakoostans Generals. Linus sent David into limbo, where he found the POLYBIUS machine, which he used to escape and attack Linus. He found out that the machine tapped in well with his VR, and used this to his advantage to build his army up even stronger. He declared war on Pakoostan again, and held up such a fight that Pakoo himself had to come fight David. Pakoo bested him in battle and launched him into space. After some time, David finally hit a moon, waking up from his coma.
