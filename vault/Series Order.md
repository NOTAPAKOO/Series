I'm thinking of doing the shorter 10-12 minute episodes, assuming I can't cram that much in to add up to 24. I would want to do like 10-12 episode seasons, maybe make the first season shorter? See how well things plan out.

Season 1

1. Pilot

K-17 tells his story and lays the groundwork for the world and the setting.

K-17 explores an abandoned part of the facility with his friend, K-19.

2. Show Off (K-18)

K-18 tries to show that he is just as interesting as the others.

3. F@#K Kitchen (K-19)

Addy and the others try to find something K-19 enjoys doing, K-19 has a dream about the perfect restaurant.

4. A (K-20)


5. Clean Up (K-21)

The ground splits open, Addy "Dies" in the Electric Core.

Season 3

The K-Types become Addyless, K-19 becomes de facto leader.

Not sure if I still want to keep the K-19 becomes Addy, then Addy turns the K-19Addy into the Hartman.
